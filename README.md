> ### Use an LLM to generate test cases and execute them for validation.

We are using an LLM to generate unit tests for our code automatically. Once generated, the tests are run to check if they behave as expected and properly validate the functionality


## :computer: Tech Stack
- [**Go**](https://go.dev/) : Programming language
- [**Azure OpenAI/ChatGPT 4.1 Mini**](https://github.com/marketplace/models/azure-openai/gpt-4-1-mini): Utilized as the LLM backend to generate meaningful and contextual unit test cases for C++ code.
- [**CCP Project (orgChartApi)**](https://github.com/keploy/orgChartApi): The C++ project under test. The tool integrates with the CCP codebase to build the binary, generate test cases, and run them for validation.

<br>

## :book: How to Use / Run on Your Machine

- ### Prerequisites:
    - Install Go (version >= 1.23.3): https://golang.org/dl/
    - Setup the CCP Project locally (don't use docker to setup this project)
      - [Setup Instruction](https://github.com/keploy/orgChartApi?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-manual-setup-without-docker)


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> I am using WSL (Ubuntu).

<br>

### :toolbox: Setup Project Locally:

- Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/saketv8/test-generator-llm.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd test-generator-llm
```
- Setup Env Variable:

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> get your own github personal access Token [Here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

```sh
# rename <.env.example> to <.env>
# and
# set your own github_token

# sample
GITHUB_PAT=YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE
```

- Install dependencies:
```sh
go mod download
```

- Building the Application Binary:
```sh
go build -o test-generator-llm
```

- Starting the Application:
```sh
./test-generator-llm
```

- Check the terminal output
> :rocket: You're all set!
